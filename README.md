Latex-Theorem
=============

A personal use latex package for highlight the mathematical logic in a text.



## TODO:
1. [ ] Identify all the sentences which require an " encapsulation box" and write a "phylosphical" pseudo-definition of them in the  [example file](Latex-Theorem/ProgettoTeorem_v2.tex).
2. [ ] Determine a good fancy style for each sentence :
 - box shape
 - colour
 - title ( yes/no , style)
 - Use of different fonts inside box
 - enumeration style 
3. [ ] Determine a good fancy style for chapter and paragraph title.
4. [ ] Repeat previous step to make a more serious style suitable for more official purposes.
5. [ ] Trasform the ["input file"](Latex-Theorem/TheoremTemplateToninus.tex) protype in a latex package.
 - Implement the possibility of choosing between fancy-style / serious-style in the preamle as a \usepackage option.
6. [ ] Transform the example file in a proper "package guide" in the latex-community style.
7. [ ] Write a good prentation / motivation to encourage people to enrich this project.
 - a better catalogation of sentences in mathematical sciences.
 - creation of modular text.
 - use of color to take advantage of the visual memory.
